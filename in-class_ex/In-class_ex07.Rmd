```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```


# Getting Started

Before getting started, it is important to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment. 

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('igraph', 'tidygraph', 
             'ggraph', 'visNetwork', 
             'lubridate', 'clock',
             'tidyverse', 'ggmap')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# Importing the data

The code chunk below imports GAStech_email_node.csv from the data folder into R by using `read_csv()` of tidyverse package and saves it as a data frame called GAStech_nodes. Step is repeated for data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv.

After importing the data file into R, it is important for us to review the data object. We do this using `glimpse()`.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_node.csv")
GAStech_edges <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv")

glimpse(GAStech_nodes)
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

# Prepping the data

To get the Sentdate in proper day, month, year format using `dmy()` and get the weekday.

```{r}
GAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>%
  mutate(SentDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>%
  mutate(Weekday = weekdays(SentDate))
```

## Wrangling attribute



```{r}
GAStech_edges_agg <- GAStech_edges %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>%
  summarise(Weight = n()) %>%
  filter(source!=target) %>%
  filter(Weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup
```


# Building graph model

```{r}
GAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,
                           edges = GAStech_edges_agg,
                           directed = TRUE)

GAStech_graph
```

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph,
       layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph()

```

## Modifying the nodes

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph,
       layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = Department,
                      size = 3)) +
  theme_graph()

```


## Modifying the Edges

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph,
       layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Weight,
                     alpha = 0.1
                     )) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = Department,
                      size = 3)) +
  theme_graph()

```


## Working with facet edges

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph,
       layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Weight,
                     alpha = 0.1
                     )) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = Department,
                      size = 3)) +
  theme_graph() +
  facet_edges(~Weekday)
```


## Working with facet node

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph,
       layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Weight,
                     alpha = 0.1
                     )) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = Department,
                      size = 3)) +
  theme_graph() +
  facet_nodes(~Department)
```


## Network Metrics Analysis

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,
            size=betweenness_centrality))
g + theme_graph()
```


# Data preparation for visNetwork

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("sourceLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(from = id) %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("targetLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(to = id) %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
    summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  filter(from!=to) %>%
  filter(weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

# Plotting interactive netowrk graph via visNetwork

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, 
           GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

## Using Fruchterman and Reingold layout

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, 
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr")
```
## Highlighting the nodes


```{r}
GAStech_nodes2 <- GAStech_nodes %>%
  rename(group = Department)
```

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes2,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

## Improving the edges

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes2,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visEdges(arrows = "to", 
           smooth = list(enabled = TRUE, 
                         type = "curvedCW")) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```
## Giving it interactivity

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes2,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,
             nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```
