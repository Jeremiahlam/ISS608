# Overview

In this Take-home Exercise, I will review one of my [**peers work**](https://kimsiang-va.netlify.app/takehome_exercise/takehome_exercise_1.html) and critic it in terms of clarity and aesthetics. Subsequently, I will remake the original design by using data visualisation principles and best practices.

Before getting started, it is important to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. 

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
# Importing Data
The code chunk below imports *Participants.csv* from the data folder into R by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) package and saves it as a tibble data frame called *Participants*. This is the same data set that was utilized by my peer for his take-home exercise.

```{r}
Participants <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")
```
